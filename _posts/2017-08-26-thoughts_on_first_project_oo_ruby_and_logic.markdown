## Go for a walk, clear your mind...

### It’s very scary how important learning to code has become to me. I understand there is a good balance for everything; taking a lunch break, stopping when I get too frustrated, walking away to go live my life are all okay actions, right? The mind of a competitive would disagree, but I have no one to compete with, it’s just me against meeting my own goals and I’m having the hardest time stepping away. This journey means everything to me. 

### I’d like to say I’m blazing through OO Ruby but that is not the case. There are a couple of concepts I’m not quite comprehending: class constructors, class operators, heck! all advanced class methods, if we’re being honest here. 

### I reached out for help today, first online, then I just asked my partner (he’s a fancy web wizard). I was thoroughly impressed by his thought process. It is insane how the mind of a web developer works. Watching him carefully work out the problems and explain to me with his own logic how to solve my tests was so so cool!. I must say I can’t wait to get to that level myself. I feel I know so much, but why am I sometimes hitting blank walls? I guess the answer will always be, I have only been doing this for four weeks. And he has for 10 years!  Ugh. I have so much to learn. 

### Today marks the beginning of week five in the Web Developer program, my very first project is coming up. I don’t know exactly what the requirements are just yet, but I’ve already started snooping around other blogs to see what people think about it. Although I know I shouldn’t get ahead of myself, it is very hard for me to not know things. I am very excited to start working on it, but like I said, shouldn't get too ahead of myself. 

### I need to learn that all hard work will payoff, one step at a time and just keep going. It's totally normal to struggle at the beginning. Like Avi said in one of the videos of his I've watched, "If you don't like starting over, don't quit". It is okay to take the time necessary to actually learn and understand concepts. Take it easy, love to code, learn to love to code. All of the positive learning vibes to all of us!

### I promise my next post will be on something super technical and cool about my very first project.

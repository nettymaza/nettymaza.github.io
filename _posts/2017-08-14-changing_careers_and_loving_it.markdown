## Why I decided to learn Web Development

### Making a career change when you're nearing 30 isn't the easiest decision a person can make; however, it is easily the most important decision I've made in the last ten years. I first took an interest in computer programming about three years ago, I had taken some time off after graduating from college to travel around the world and to explore places I had never been to. Around that time, a couple of my  friends had started to learn to Web Develop because they wanted to change their careers, this wasnâ€™t my interest at the time but i was still very curious as to how the building of web sites worked and I needed a project to keep my mind occupied during long train station waits and in between layovers.

### I had so much time off during my travels, I decided to sign up for treehouse, I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS, now when I say a little, I mean just a little bit. I built a small static site about myself and my travels, I even learned how to set up hosting, how to get my own domain and other website things I had never heard about. My site was small, but the reward was pretty big. It felt so good to be able to build something, from scratch and on my own.

### It took me a long time to realize that web development can open up so many doors. Not only professionally but also personally, I love the challenge of constantly learning new things, stepping out of my comfort zone, the feeling of progress, moving forward and constant personal growth. I mean the learning never ends, I can't begin to tell you how many times a day I have to google concepts I don't understand or know about. It can sound kind of crazy to some but I think it is exactly what I want my career life to be about --Constant growth and opportunity.

# Why I decided to learn Web Development

## Making a career change when you're nearing 30 isn't the easiest decision a person can make; however, it is one of the most important decisions I've made in the last ten years. I first took an interest in computer programming about three years ago, I had taken some time off after graduating from college because I wanted to explore, travel to places I'd never been to and celebrate that I had finished my career in Medical Lab Science. Around that time, a couple of my friends had started to learn Web Development because they wanted to change their careers, this wasnâ€™t my interest at the time but it spiked my curiosity as to how the building of web sites worked. I needed a personal project to keep my mind occupied during long train station waits and something productive to do during layovers. 

## I had so much time off that I decided to sign up for treehouse. I started with a little bit of HTML and CSS, now when I say a little, I mean just a little bit. I built a small static site about myself and my travels, I even learned how to set up hosting, how to get my own domain and other website things I had never heard about. My site was small, but the reward was pretty big. It felt so good to be able to build something from scratch and on my own.

## Fast forward to now, three years later and after deciding that working in a laboratory wasn't for me, I find my self here learning something new. I'm making a career change into something that has the potential to always keep me on my toes, just the way I want it to be and although the feeling of starting over can make me feel a bit overwhelmed, it is important to note that one step at a time will get me there. I feel excited to learn, create and develop. 


## It took me a long time to realize that web development can open up so many doors. Not only professionally but also personally, I love the challenge of learning new things, stepping out of my comfort zone and that feeling of progress and constant personal growth. I mean the learning never ends, I can't begin to tell you how many times a day I have to google concepts I don't understand or know about. It can sound kind of crazy to some but I think it is exactly what I want my career life to be about -- constant growth and opportunity.

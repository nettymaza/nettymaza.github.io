Finally! Time to submit project #4. YES, and Awesome! I must say this project finally helped me understand why javascript is so cool!. It has always been an intimidating language to me, but I've come to the realization it is an important one to master. I'm not going to lie, I definitely miss the 'niceness' of Ruby's synthax, but what's a few more curly braces? and how about those cool callback functions?, all worth it to add  cool new functionalities to my app. 

Learning a new language and then having to add new features to a pre-existing project seemed daunting and super intimidating. So many different concepts and different ways to do the same thing, one better than the other can leave the aspiring web developer a little confused. 

My Rails project is an app that allows you manage your upcoming vacations. The app is named Pack-it  jQuery version.  Its a simple app where  you can create and account, add trips, then build your packing list for each trip by adding items to it. Sweet!

The purpose of this project is to add dynamic front-end responses by connecting to my Rails API by using jQuery-a JavaScript librairy,  and requesting JSON data, which I can then use to inject into the DOM without having to redirect the user to a new page. So many things to understand, but one step in front of the other will get you there, right?  :)

Aside front dealing with a few turbo-links issues, my project went smoothly and I was able to meet all requirements in a considerate amount of time. 

Here are a few definitions I googled in case you need a refresher of what some of these are.


> What is jQuery? 
>  jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. -https://jquery.com/

> What Is JSON?
> JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner -Copterlabs
